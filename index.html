        <h2>Technical Projects</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>Pharmacy Accessibility</h2>
          <p class="description">
            As part of my Big Data Management & Analytics course, I spearheaded a project to develop a Tableau dashboard that presented crucial pharmacy data alongside 
            demographic information. Built a linear regression model that accurately predicted the number of pharmacies for counties without data, 
            allowing us to identify under-served and over-served counties. Proposed new pharmacy locations based on the number of pharmacies serving every 10k people, 
            aimed at improving access to healthcare in those areas. 
          </p>

          <h2>Cyberminer</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Designed and developed a basic search engine using Node and MongoDB as part of a team project for the Object Oriented Analysis & Design course. 
            The project aimed to improve our understanding of object-oriented principles in software development, and to utilize UML as a tool for the 
            design and analysis phase of the software development lifecycle. I gained valuable experience in applying OOP principles to 
            real-world software development challenges and further developed my skills in UML modelling.
          </p>

          <h2>Art Auction System</h2>
          <p class="description">
            As part of my coursework in Database Design, I collaborated with a team to design and develop an online art auction database system. 
            The project involved creating the databases using MySQL and developing the backend services 
            using Node. Our team successfully implemented a system that allowed artists and sellers to auction their paintings while providing buyers with the 
            ability to bid on paintings they were interested in. 
            This project provided me with the opportunity to enhance my skills in database design and development, 
            as well as fostered my ability to effectively collaborate and work as part of a team.
          </p>

          <h2>Predicting Hacks Before They Happen</h2>
          <p class="description">
            During a hackathon, I developed a predictive model to address the increasing occurrence of hacking in digital payments. 
            The model utilizes 15 anonymized features to predict the likelihood of a hack, providing the cybersecurity team with valuable insights 
            to prevent and protect against potential threats. Through this project, I gained practical experience in cybersecurity and data analytics, 
            while also demonstrating my ability to innovate and problem-solve in a time-sensitive environment.
          </p>

          <h2>Wind Farm Layout Optimization</h2>
          <p class="description">
            Participated in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/digitalisation/digital-technologies/shell-ai.html">Shell.ai</a> hackathon with a friend and achieved a top 10% rank among 1530 teams by proposing a Python-based solution 
            for wind farm layout optimization. Utilizing genetic algorithm, we determined the optimal layout for 50 turbines resulting in a 
            mean Annual Energy Production (AEP) score of 532.04931 GWh. 
            This experience provided me with valuable insights into using data-driven solutions to address complex problems in the energy sector.

          <p class="description">
            Proposed  a hybrid algorithm that combines the advantages of Gravitational Search and Cuckoo Search algorithms to improve job 
            scheduling efficiency in a cloud computing environment. By framing job scheduling as an optimization problem, 
            the algorithm aims to explore the search space and perform local search effectively, leading to an optimal solution.
